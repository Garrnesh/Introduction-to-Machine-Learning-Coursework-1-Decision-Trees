# COMP60012: Introduction to ML - Decision Tree Coursework
## About
This is a coursework for COMP60012: Introduction to ML that implements a decision tree algorithm and uses it to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone.

## Files
This repository contains the following files:
- [Decision_Tree.ipynb](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/Decision_Tree.ipynb) contains the implementation of the algorithm for training desicion trees including the decision_tree_learning(dataset, depth) function as asked in the requirements.
- [clean_dataset.txt](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/clean_dataset.txt) contains the clean dataset provided by the project spec.
- [noisy_dataset.txt](https://github.com/Garrnesh/Intro-to-ML/blob/main/noisy_dataset.txt) contains the noisy dataset provided by the project spec.
